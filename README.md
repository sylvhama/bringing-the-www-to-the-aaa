# [Bringing the WWW to the AAA](https://bringing-the-www-to-the-aaa.netlify.app/)
Presentation about some of my work at Ubisoft Club for Montreal React meetup. I also have shared more details in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sylvhama/status/1046820308647387141).

## Abstract

Nowadays most of developers are familiar with making single-page applications which will adapt to desktop and mobile devices. But not all of them had to deal with TV screens and gamepad based controls. The goal of this talk is to explain how React ecosystem is helping us at Ubisoft Club to build a solid user experience for our worldwide AAA users. Wikipedia note:
> AAA (pronounced "triple A") is a classification term used for games with the highest development budgets and levels of promotion.
